### What I learned

This is my first challenge in React after doing a few beginner courses and I'm really enjoying the experience of putting together small apps using React and thinking in components. I have done a lot with state and a little bit with useEffect so my usage might not be best practice here, however I am currently doing courses which are getting into more intermediate & advanced topics.

I tried to style the components with their own individual .scss files but it was a nightmare when trying to use global SCSS variables. Will revisit this in future as I haven't started journeying into best ways of styling React components.
